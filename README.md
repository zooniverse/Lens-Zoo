### Notes

Played around with compressing guide pngs to jpgs.  Not really worth it, as the jpgs are larger, unless we apply a gaussian blur to reduce the noise levels.

    for f in *.png;
    do
      filename="${f%.*}";
      convert ${f} ${filename}.jpg;
      convert -strip -interlace Plane -gaussian-blur 0.01 -quality 85% ${filename}.jpg ${filename}.jpg
    done
