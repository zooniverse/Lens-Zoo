# Reconfiguring SW website for CFHTLS stage 2. Need to run the site locally, to
# check appearance, performance etc. 
# 
# Follow Amit's instructions:
#
#     The readme should get you going. You need to install Node. 
#     Then from the project root directory, run
# 
#     npm install
#     hem server --includeCss

# Here's the contents of the README.md:

#     ## Setting up
# 
#         git clone git@github.com:zooniverse/Lens-Zoo.git
#         npm install .
# 
#     ## Starting local server
# 
#         hem server --includeCss
# 
#     ## Building subjects
# 
#         cd /path/to/ouroboros
#         rails r /path/to/spacewarps/data-import/builder.rb
# 
#     or to build against staging server
# 
#         RAILS_ENV=staging rails r /path/to/spacewarps/data-import/builder.rb
#         ssh ubuntu@dev.zooniverse.org
#         cd /rails/apps/ouroboros_staging/current
#         sudo -u www-data bundle exec rails c staging
# 
#         # Clear the redis cache
#         SpacewarpSubject.redis_set.destroy
# 
#         # Activate subjects
#         SpacewarpGroup.activate
# 
#     ## Building and deploying project
# 
#         ./build.rb

# Done. Now start server:

hem server --includeCss
# path.existsSync is now called `fs.existsSync`.
# >> Strata web server version 0.15.1 running on node 0.8.2
# >> Listening on 0.0.0.0:9294, CTRL+C to stop

# OK good! This terminal is now unusable, as the server is there listening in the
# background. Probably we could bg it, but its OK to just use a different term.

# Now - do we need to do the ouruboros stuff? Or can we just build?
# Try it:

./build.rb

# ./build.rb:5: syntax error, unexpected ':', expecting $end
# AWS.config access_key_id: ENV['S3_ACCESS_ID'], secret_a...

# Looks like ruby script is expecting some Amazon passwords or something.
# Do we need this? Or can we run even more locally somehow, just for 
# site testing?

# How to handle website reconfigurations?
# One branch per survey and stage? Or files stored per survey and stage?
# Or, one branch per survey, and keep separate files for stages?
#   This latter one has nice features: lots of PNG files needed for website
#   could be kept in separate branches. Stage 2 edits are minor, in principle
#   - so could be handled by 
# 
# Plan:
#
# * Fork Lens-Zoo repo to drphilmarshall              DONE
# * Make Aprajita and Anupreeta collaborators         DONE

# * Create dev branch to work in                      DONE
# * Keep copies of stage 1 html, eco files:           DONE
#     * public/index_CFHTLS_stage1.html               DONE
#     * app/views/classifier_CFHTLS_stage1.eco        DONE
#     * app/views/profile_subjects_CFHTLS_stage1.eco  DONE
# * Reconfigure the following files:
#     * public/index_CFHTLS_stage2.html               IN PROGRESS
#     * app/views/classifier_CFHTLS_stage2.eco        IN PROGRESS
#     * app/views/profile_subjects_CFHTLS_stage2.eco  IN PROGRESS
# * Write simple shell script to reconfigure website  IN PROGRESS
# * Test local dev branch site using hem server       IN PROGRESS
# * Merge in Zooniverse changes to master branch
# * When ready:
#     * Merge dev branch into master branch
#     * Submit pull request
#     
# Notes:
# 
# - Local master branch is to be kept a clean copy of the remote Zooniverse 
#   Lens-Zoo repo. Pull in Amit's edits using:
#   
# 
#   git checkout master   
#    (to move to the master branch of drphilmarshall/Lens-Zoo)
# 
#   git remote add upstream https://github.com/zooniverse/Lens-Zoo.git
#    (to connect yourself to the zooniverse version of the repo)
# 
#   git fetch upstream/master
#    (to get any new changes that Amit made)
# 
# 
#   git checkout dev
#        (to return to your local dev branch)
#
#   git merge master
#        (to merge in changes from the master branch)
# 
#   git push origin dev
#        (to push committed changes in your local dev branch to the dev branch at https://github.com/drphilmarshall/Lens-Zoo)
