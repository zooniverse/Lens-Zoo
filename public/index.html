            <p>A gravitational lens is a distribution of matter &ndash; such as a cluster of galaxies &ndash;
              between a distant source (a background galaxy) and an observer, that is capable of bending
              (lensing) the light.</p>

          <h2>Gravitational Lensing</h2>
          <p>Einstein's theory of gravity, General Relativity, made a remarkable prediction. Massive objects, like galaxies or clusters of galaxies, should bend the space around them such that passing light rays follow curved paths: they behave like "gravitational lenses," focusing the light and distorting and magnifying the images of distant galaxies in the background. When one of these spacewarps happens to sit right in front of a background galaxy, the magnification factor can be upto 10 times or more, giving us a zoomed-in view of the distant universe, just at that particular point. Lenses can help us investigate young galaxies more than halfway across the universe, as they formed stars and started to take on the familiar shapes we see nearby.
</p>
          <p>As well as being useful as cosmic telescopes, gravitational lenses can be used to weigh the galaxy or cluster that is warping the space: with high magnification comes multiple images of the background galaxy, arranged around the image of the deflector. The separation and distortion of the lensed images contains information about how much mass there is in the lens, and how it is arranged: it's one of the few ways we have of mapping out where the dark matter in the universe is. How clumpy the dark matter is, and how dense it is near the centers of galaxies, can tell us about how galaxies evolve, and perhaps even what the dark matter is.</p>
          <h2>Needles in a Haystack</h2>
          <p>
          There is a lot of interesting science to be done with gravitational lenses. The problem is that they are very rare. Only about one in a thousand massive galaxies is aligned with a background object well enough to cause it to appear multiply-imaged. We know of about 400 gravitational lenses now, largely because we have become very good at observing the night sky! Modern optical surveys cover thousands of square degrees, with images sharp and deep enough to resolve about 1 lens per square degree, and that should contain millions of massive galaxies, and so thousands of lenses. All we need to do is find them!</p>
          <p>
          This is not as easy as it sounds: teaching a computer to recognize the effects of gravitational lensing is not too difficult (although there are some exceptions, overall we understand the patterns of images produced by spacewarps very well), but our robots are easily confused by galaxies that look like lens systems even though they are just galaxies. And for them to run fast on lots of imaging data, they have to cut a lot of corners, and this makes them less effective.</p>
        
          <h2>Discovering Lenses: a Human-Robot Partnership</h2>
          <p>With some understanding of what gravitational lenses do, you can help discover new examples of this amazing phenomenon, and enable our survey scientists to carry out new investigations of stars and dark matter galaxies in the universe. We will be doing two types of lens search. In our blind searches, we'll be asking you to spot signs of gravitational lensing in images of the sky taken as part of the CFHT (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope) legacy survey. This survey has been searched by robots, but we're pretty sure they didn't catch all the lenses to be found! And your results will help us re-train the robots to do better on larger surveys in future. Then, in our targeted searches, in other upcoming sky surveys, we'll be showing you galaxies and groups of galaxies that our robots have selected as possibly being lenses; your task will be to assess whether or not they actually are! In both cases, there will be confusing objects around - the challenge is to come up with the most plausible explanation for what is going on, in collaboration with the rest of the SpaceWarps community. Do you think you can spot outer space being warped?  We do!</p>

              <h2>Lensed Galaxies</h2>
              <p>In general, galaxies can be big (massive) or small (compact), with a clear shape or morphology (e.g. spiral and elliptical galaxies) or messy (e.g. irregular, clumpy and merging galaxies). As they are made up of many stars, galaxies generally appear to be extended in astronomical images, unlike single stars that just look like compact, round sources.</p>

              <p>Galaxies with lots of stars or mass can act as cosmic telescopes and bend light of a galaxy lying behind them into multiple images. Typically the most massive galaxies appear yellow-red in colour (the colour is indicative of old stars that are massive). They usually have a smooth distribution of light and are spherical or elliptical in shape. Similarly, the central bulges of large galaxies can be massive enough to cause lensing.</p>

              <p>When a distant galaxy (background source) is lensed by a galaxy lying between us and the galaxy, you can get multiple images of the galaxy that typically trace a circle around the lensing galaxy, see the examples below. The last example shows the case when the background source and the lensing galaxy almost exactly aligned along the of sight to us - this produces a lensed image that is a ring, usually referred to as an Einstein ring.</p>

              <p>If you look at the examples below you'll probably have already noticed that the lensed or distorted images tend to be blue rather than the yellow/red of the lensing galaxy. This is partly because more distant galaxies are more likely to be young and so they have a lot of young stars that predominantly create more energetic photons or blue light. In addition, distant galaxies are "redshifted" this means the light you actually see originated from a shorter or bluer wavelength. Hence distant galaxies tend to look blue. While this is typically true for most of the lenses you will see, if these objects are at very high redshift, it can be that the bright blue photons that are emitted are so far away that they actually arrive at earth at even longer wavelengths. These images will appear red in our colour composites. So don't reject red arcs or images - these could just be at high redshift!. There's an example of a high-redshift lensed quasar in lensed quasars.</p>

              <p>This faint blue galaxy is being magnified and distorted into an arc by the massive red galaxy. See how the arc curves around the lens. If you look closely there is a hint of a counter-image (a second image opposite side of the lens to the primary arc). It is the same colour as the primary arc but it is typically fainter. Because of this sometimes the counter image is bright enough to be seen but sometimes it's too faint to be seen.</p>

              <p>Very massive galaxies can cause multiple images to form. Here you see a blue arc and two additional blue images, these are arranged roughly on a circle around the lensing galaxy. This standard lens configuration is called the <em>fold configuration</em>.</p>

              <p>In the very rare instance that a background galaxy is (almost perfectly) aligned to the foreground galaxy along the line of sight to us, the light of the background galaxy is deflected in all directions. This give rise to a ring-like lensed image and is called an Einstein Ring.</p>

              <section data-type='lensed-quasars'>
              <h2>Lensed Quasars</h2>
              <p>Quasars or quasi-stellar objects are very compact galaxies that have very bright central regions that outshine the rest of the galaxy making it look "star-like". The nucleus is so bright because it's massive and it's made up of millions of stars with a very massive black hole. As matter falls into the black hole it lights up making the nucleus very bright. When a compact object like a quasar is lensed by a galaxy that's lying between us and the quasar it is lensed into discrete multiple images like the examples shown below. Quasars are rare compared to galaxies and hence, lensed quasars are even rarer than lensed galaxies. Below the examples show quasars lensed by a single galaxy, quasars lensed by a galaxy group are even rarer. To date, only three quasars lensed by a galaxy group/cluster have been found.</p>
              
              <h4>Double</h4>
              <img class='lazy' src='' data-original='images/guide/lenses/galaxy-quasar/CFHTLS_082_0427_gri.png' width='340' height='340'>

              <p>This is a bright blue "quasi-stellar object" behind a massive galaxy: it has been lensed into two images, one on either side of the lens galaxy.</p>
              
              <h4>Quad</h4>
              <img class='lazy' src='' data-original='images/guide/lenses/galaxy-quasar/CFHTLS_082_1138_gri.png' width='340' height='340'>

              <p>This quasar has been lensed into four images, arranged around the galaxy. This is called the Einstein cross configuration. Quads are about 6 times rarer than doubles.</p>

              <h4>High-z</h4>
              <img class='lazy' src='' data-original='images/guide/lenses/galaxy-quasar/CFHTLS_082_1222_gri.png' width='340' height='340'>

              <p>This is a quasar at high redshift, so it appears yellow-ish. The image configuration in this case is a quad, with two images very close together.</p>

              <p>Galaxy groups and clusters are gravitationally bound entities. They mark the most massive regions in the Universe. As such these are the most powerful cosmic telescopes and can produce large and spectacular arcs and multiple images. See the examples below.</p>

              <p>Groups or clusters of massive red galaxies can lens background galaxies into long, bright arcs. These arcs are typically less curved and at larger separations from the lensing galaxies than would be seen for a single lensing galaxy. This is because groups and clusters of galaxies are much more massive than a single galaxy and so the deflection of the image (or separation) can be larger.
              </p>

                <p>Ring and Spiral galaxies are common galaxy types. These are not massive galaxies but are typically actively forming-stars and therefore the rings and arms look blue. Spiral arms are a common feature, such as found in our own Milky Way. Ring galaxies may be formed by the interaction of two star-forming galaxies. Depending on orientation, spiral arms and rings can look similar to gravitationally lensed images of a background galaxy, these are common false positives. Some tips on how to distinguish them from the real thing are below.</p>

                <p>These often have yellow "bulges" and blue "spiral arms." Unlike arcs, the arms don't trace a rough circle around the bulge, and is usually accompanied by some fuzzy distribution of light.</p>

                <p>As we described previously, a galaxy needs to be massive to act as a gravitational lens.
                Spiral and irregular galaxies are not massive enough to cause strong gravitational lensing usually. However, there are some known cases of spiral galaxies (both seen face-on and edge-on) acting as gravitational lenses.  While thinking about whether you are seeing gravitational lensing it's worthwhile considering if the object you think is the lens is massive enough or is it a "lightweight"? Do you see any other evidence that might disfavor lensing e.g. the lensed images are too far or the arc is too straight? Here are some examples.</p>
                <h4>Straight or Distant Arclets</h4>

                <p>Sometimes a yellow/red galaxy is present near a blue arc but its too small to create such a large or separated arc. The arc might appear too curved or curved in the wrong direction (it doesn't encircle the lensing galaxy). In the case above, the arc is too far away to be lensed by such a small galaxy.</p>
                <h4>Bulgeless Blue Galaxies</h4>
                <img class='lazy' src='' data-original='images/guide/non-lenses/lightweights/CFHTLS_152_7089_17977_b_gri.png' width='340' height='340'>

                <p>The most massive galaxies have bulges of yellow/red stars &ndash; bulgeless, blue galaxies usually don't have enough mass to strongly deflect light. Such galaxies are less likely to act as lenses.</p>

                <h2>Mergers &amp; Neighbours</h2>
                <p>As you may have seen in <a href='http://www.galaxyzoo.org/'>Galaxy Zoo</a>, galaxies are moving objects that sometime collide and interact. This produces a single more massive galaxy at the end, but as the interaction is very complex and slow, spiral arms and star forming regions from both of the merging galaxies can be tidally distorted and drawn out. Usually, these merging galaxies can be identified due to their similar colors since such galaxies have roughly similar stellar population and ages. Below we give an example of how such mergers can be mistaken to be a lensing galaxy. These arms & tidal tails can end up looking similar to long blue arcs seen in lensing around the central redder bulge of the merging galaxies. Below we give an example of how such mergers can be mistaken to be a lensing galaxy.</p>
                <p>Sometimes two neighbouring galaxies, that aren't physically associated to each other, but are simply next to each other can look like a lens. This is just a chance or random alignment of galaxies. For lensing candidates remember to look for an arc that is defined and curved around a plausible lensing galaxy, and also look for hints of a counter image. If things look very nebulous & fuzzy or curved the wrong way, it's most likely this isn't a lens. See the example below.</p>
                <h4>Mergers</h4>
                <img class='lazy' src='' data-original='images/guide/non-lenses/spirals-rings/CFHTLS_001_1555_gri.png' width='340' height='340'>

                <p>Two galaxies merging together can look a bit like a lens system. Her two spiral galaxies appear to be merging with multiple arms and a fuzzy distribution of light. Sometimes mergers cause displaced arms, or tidal tails. Unlike arcs, the arms or tidal tails do not trace a circle around the red bulge.</p>
                
                <h4>Neighbouring Galaxies</h4>
                <img class='lazy' src='' data-original='images/guide/non-lenses/lightweights/CFHTLS_084_6943_2087_b_gri.png' width='340' height='340'>

                <p>Sometimes two neighbouring galaxies can look a bit like a lens system. In these cases usually the supposed "arc" is not bright enough, it is not clearly defined or is fuzzy or the "lens" is not massive enough (as above).</p>
