    details:
      lensing_cluster:
        option_1: "Groups/Clusters of galaxies are the most massive objects in the universe! They can cause arcs to appear many galaxy diameters away from the centre of the group."
        option_2: "The massive galaxies in a lensing group typically have similar yellow-red colors. This should help you figure out which galaxies are in the group, and which are not."
        option_3: "Typically, any lensed arcs will appear to be surrounding the cluster as a whole - although galaxies within the cluster can also act as lenses on their own."
        option_4: "If you see an arc, look for a “counter-image” with the about the same color and brightness somewhere else around the centre of the group, usually on the opposite side. Mark the counter-images as well, if you can!"
        option_5: "Remember, the arcs are most likely to be blue, but can be yellow or red in some cases. Multiple “images” of the same background galaxy are always the same color as each other! Try and mark each one."
        option_6: "The large separation between the group centre and the arc suggests that more mass is required in the lens than meets the eye: groups/clusters are mostly made of Dark Matter!"
        option_7: "You can read more about group lenses in the <em>Spotters Guide</em>."
      lensed_quasar:
        option_1: "Typically, lensed quasar systems show either two ('doubles') or four ('quads') small lensed features, which look like stars. Mark each of the two, or four, quasars that you see!"
        option_2: "See how the 'multiple images' of the background quasar are arranged in symmetrical patterns around the lens galaxy. Mark each one! You might have to zoom in, using the Quick Dashboard."
        option_3: "Quasars can have a wide variety of colours in infrared images, as you'll see from the many images that contain unlensed quasars at their centres."
        option_4: "Quasars look different from other galaxies, because we are not seeing starlight but rather the light from supermassive black holes in their centres. These monsters often outshine the light from the rest of the galaxy."
        option_5: "We expect lensed quasars to be about 10 times rarer than lensed galaxies, but they are really useful. You can read more about what we use gravitational lenses for on the <em>Science</em> page."
        option_6: "You can read more about lensed quasars in the <em>Spotters Guide</em>."
      lensed_galaxy:
        option_1: "The most common background galaxies in the universe are faint, blue, and star-forming, so lensed galaxies often (but not always!) appear blue-ish."
        option_2: "Unlike most galaxies you see in these images, lensed galaxies appear stretched and curved around a lensing object."
        option_3: "The lensed features in these systems are typically only a galaxy diameter or two away from the centre of the lens. You might have to zoom in, with the Quick Dashboard!"
        option_4: "Look for a faint “counter-image” with the same colour on the opposite side of the lens to the arc. Sometimes these are too faint to see though. Mark the counter-image too, if you can!"
        option_5: "The galaxy acting as a lens is most likely to be a bright, smooth, orange elliptical galaxy, since these are the most massive galaxies."
        option_6: "Very occasionally, if the cosmic alignment is very precise, the galaxy behind the lens will appear as an almost exactly circular Einstein Ring."
        option_7: "You can read more about lensed galaxies in the <em>Spotters Guide</em>."

      CFHTLS_stage2_fps:
        stars: "Yellow-red (or white-blue or white-green) stars can look like lens galaxies, but are smaller, very close to circular, and in CFHTLS images often have 'spikes' coming out of them at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o clock."
        stars_1: "A bright blue star, that has two red compact sources neighbouring it i.e. there is no lensing galaxy in this image. Also, if the two red compact sources were lensed background galaxies, they would be symmetrically arranged either side of the lens to be a lensing feature."
        stars_2: "The red object is not a galaxy but a single red star (that cannot act as a lens). Stars are more defined than fuzzy galaxies (see the yellow galaxies in this field). The neighbouring blue 'arc' is also too thick and not curved enought around the 'lens' to be a plausible lensed arc."
        stars_3: "Two blue objects flank a yellow object, however this is not a gravitational lens. The objects have the shapes of stars, not extended or compact galaxies that are seen in the same image. This is just a chance alignment of two blue stars and a red star in between."
        stars_4: "The yellow object that has two blue objects around it is a star, so it cannot act as a lens. The blue objects either side of the star are a little fuzzy and slightly different colours, and could be background galaxies. The red pair of objects close by are likely to be foreground red stars. This is just a chance alignment."
        stars_5: "This bright blue star has a neighbouring yellow galaxy close to it. The apparently curved shape of the yellow galaxy makes this look a bit like a gravitational lens, but a star cannot act as a lens (it doesn't have enough mass) so this is just a chance alignment of a galaxy and a star."
        stars_6: "This field contains several bright stars that cause lots of unusual effects on the images. The object to the lower middle is such a star, not a gravitational lens. The pink and blue colours arise from different effects on the images seen in different filters. So the blue ring you see is because the light from the star caused a larger area of the CCD to be affected than in the green or red bands. The neighbouring blue blobs either side are just aligned by chance."
        stars_7: "This field contains a red object flanked by two blue objects. The shape of the red object and the blue object to the left suggest that these are stars. The blue object to the right is a galaxy. This is not a lens but a chance alignment of these three unrelated objects."
        stars_8: "This is a bright yellow star, with two beighbouring blue stars. While the blue sources have very similar colours and are compact, if they were really lensed background galaxies/QSOs they would appear on opposing sides of the lensing mass. Therefore this is not a lens but a chance alignment of these unrelated objects."
        stars_9: "The potential lens here is a red star that appears to have blue arc and a blue compacts sources near it. This is not a lens as the central object is a star. The arc and blue point sources are just background sources that happen to lie here."
        red: "Spiral and ring galaxies often have red bulges that can mimic massive lens galaxies; their arms usually have the wrong shapes and positions to be lensed arcs though."
        red_sfg_1: "The pair of red objects are likely to be galaxies but may also be a pair of red stars; if they are galaxies, their mass is probably too low to produce such a large scale blue ring (and it is not centered well enough or the right shape to be lensed). This is most likely to be a pair of red galaxies whose interaction has generated a star-forming ring."
        red_sfg_2: "This is a red galaxy with a star forming ring or disk around it. The white compact object is likely to be a star that just happens to appear to fall in front of the galaxy along our line of sight, or possibly a supernova in the galaxy! The ring itself is rather wispy: one would expect a lensed ring to be sharper and clearer than this."
        red_sfg_3: "The compact red object at the centre of this object is a compact red galaxy core, the blue 'ring' around it is likely to be spiral arms in which star-formation is happening. The symmetry is not quite right for it to be lensed."
        red_sfg_4: "The compact red object at the centre of this object is a compact red galaxy core, the blue 'ring' around it is likely to be spiral arms or a broken ring in which star-formation is happening."
        red_sfg_5: "The compact red object at the centre of this object is likely to be a compact red galaxy core. The blue arc that is below is likely to be either a spiral arm in the disk of that galaxy that is forming stars."
        red_sfg_6: "The blue arcs around this red galaxy are likely spiral arms in which stars are forming producing the blue colour. There is a blue point like object on the opposite side of the galaxy to the arc, but its colour is a little different to the arc, and therefore this is unlikely to be a lensed arc and counter image."
        red_sfg_7: "This is a very compact red galaxy that has two very faint, blue, compact sources lying close by. If this was a lens, one would expect to see the ring continued around the galaxy or if that there would be a single arc with a compact blue counter image on the opposite side of the red galaxy. This is more likely to be a red galaxy core with a star forming disk, ring or arms around it."
        red_sfg_8: "This is likely to be a red galaxy with a star forming ring around it. The galaxy looks quite small and would therefore not be able to produce such a large lensed galaxy image around it; the shape and fuzziness of the ring are also a little different from what we woudl expect from a lens."
        config: "Lensed features have characteristic shapes, positions and definition, in combination: neighbouring galaxies, might look the right colour, or be curved, or have counterparts in the right place, but we need the whole package at once for a good lens candidate."
        config_1: "The shape of this blue arc looks too straight for it to be a lensed image (straight arcs are mostly produced by very massive galaxy clusters/groups). If the pair of blue compact sources were lensed images of a background quasar they would be on diametrically opposite sides of the lensing galaxy. Images of lensed QSOs could appear in these poisitons if a third image was present to the north, but this is not seen."
        config_2: "This is a very compact group of yellow galaxies (three members). Lensed images should have similar colours so the red and blue objects are not lensed images."
        config_3: "This is a compact red galaxy that has an elongated blue neighbour. The blue 'arc' looks rather mis-shapen and is much larger than a lensed arc this galaxy could produce. If this was a lensed arc it would be curved very nicely around the compact red object."
        config_4: "There are wispy elongated and compact blue objects around this yellow galaxy. If these were lensed images they would be arranged in a more circular fashion around the lensing galaxy. If the compact blue objects were lensed images, they would fall either side of the short axis of the lensing galaxy, not on the ling axis, so this configuration is not consistent with lensing."
        config_5: "This is actually a star-forming disk galaxy seen edge-on, that typically do not have enough mass to act as gravitational lenses. The neighbouring blue sources are unlikely to be lensed QSOs because they have different colours and shapes (the one above is very compact and bright blue, whereas the one below is more fuzzy). The blue objects are likely a foreground star (above) and below a faint blue galaxy, so this is just a chance alignment."
        config_6: "This looks to be a pair of red galaxies, with a white compact source to the left, a fuzzy whitish blob to the south and a blue fuzzy object to the north. This is not a lens as the objects are not configured in a circular fashion around the lens and do not have the same colours. This is just a random alignment of galaxies."
        config_7: "This appears to be a star forming galaxy with a compact red core. The red compact objects could be thought of as forming a quad configuration but the middle one has a different colour to the other two. This is just a chance alignment of objects and is not lensing."
        config_8: "This is a blue star-forming galaxy that has a three compact sources around it. This is not lensing because the lensed images would all be of the same colour (here two are blue and one is red), the images would be arranged differently around the lens, also typically (although not always) blue star-forming galaxies do not have enough mass to act as lenses."
        config_9: "This small yellow galaxy with two blue objects either side is not a lens system. The two bluish galaxies have different colours, if these were lensed objects they would be the same colour. Also they are too far apart to be lensed images produced by such a small yellow galaxy."
        spirals: "Spiral and ring galaxies often have yellow-red bulges that can mimic massive lens galaxies; their arms usually have the wrong shapes and positions to be lensed arcs though."
        spirals_rings_1: "The long blue feature looks like a spiral arm or a broken section of a ring galaxy. This is supported by other bluish fuzzy features around the galaxy forming no particular lensing configuration expected for a typical lens."
        spirals_rings_2: "A prominent bluish ring like emission in a nearby ring galaxy. Einstein ring images are usually formed much close together to the lensing galaxy which is rather circular in shape."
        spirals_rings_3: "A spiral galaxy with bluish arms and knots showing star-forming regions. No obvious signs of any lensed images expected for a typical lens (see Spotter's guide)."
        spirals_rings_4: "A spiral barred galaxy with fuzzy gas-like emission. The bluish features in the vicinity are most likely spiral arms, they don't resemble any typical lensing configurations."
        spirals_rings_5: "A spiral galaxy with fuzzy gas-like emission and bluish arm. No sign of blue counter-image on the other side."
        spirals_rings_6: "A ring galaxy with very low surface brightness blue emission in a circle around it. The large size indicates a nearby ring galaxy. Such cases of low mass and nearby galaxies are not suitable for producing typical lensing effects."
        spirals_rings_7: "A face-on spiral galaxy with 2 bright blue knots. No counter-images of the blue knots, expected in lensing, are seen on the other side of the galaxy. Knots probably are star-forming regions in the spiral galaxy."
        spirals_rings_8: "A face-on spiral galaxy with blue spiral arms. The two smaller yellow galaxies are closeby in projection, probably. No presence of typical lensing features."
        neighbour: "Lensed features have characteristic shapes, positions and definition, in combination: neighbouring galaxies, might look the right colour, or be curved, or have counterparts in the right place, but we need the whole package at once for a good lens candidate."
        neighbour_1: "A distorted bluish arm like feature, disturbed morphology and the presence of multiple bright nuclei indicate a likely merger between two galaxies."
        neighbour_2: "The curvature of the blue arc looks right but is widely separated from the reddish yellow galaxy. This is unlikely to be a lens since more mass is required and there's no hint of a galaxy group (i.e more mass) to cause wide separation of the arc."
        neighbour_3: "The blue feature does not have the right distance, curvature, thickness with respect to the yellow galaxy to be termed as a lensed arc. Most likely two blue edge-on galaxies that are close either physically or in projection."
        neighbour_4: "Lack of curvature in the blue feature in spite of its extreme proximity to the reddish spiral galaxy suggests absence of lensing. This appears to be a blue edge-on galaxy that has a chance alignment with the reddish face-on spiral galaxy."
        neighbour_5: "A small blue galaxy appears to be in close projection to a spiral dusty galaxy. No signs of multiple lensed images."
        neighbour_6: "An edge-on spiral galaxy with distorted blue spiral arms and fuzzy gas-like emission indicates a likely merger rather than possibility of lensing."
        neighbour_7: "Several blue features around distorted yellow galaxy(s) along with the presence of gas-like emission are clear signs of a merger. The blue features do not form any expected lensing configuration."
        neighbour_8: "Two bright overlapping nuclei with spiral arms stretched out along with hints of gas is a good sign of a merger between two galaxies. No obvious signs of lensing especially because the blue feature does not lie along the tangential direction and appears more convincing as a spiral arm."
        neighbour_9: "A short straight blue object is most likely an edge-on galaxy in close projection with the massive elliptical galaxy as there's no hint of a counter-image on the other side of the elliptical."
        neighbour_10: "A galaxy with just two equally bright blue objects on the same side implies chance alignment of objects. For a real lens, two more images are expected to be seen on the other sides of the galaxy (see Spotter's Guide)."
        neighbour_11: "The blue object is not curved enough, too far from the spiral galaxy and pretty wide to look like a real lensed arc. Also, the lensing galaxy is a clear spiral implying less mass and thus, making an arc form much closer."
        loner_lightweight: "The galaxies that are massive enough to cause gravitational lensing are bright, yellow to red in colour, and typically smooth and elliptical-shaped. If you can't see a lot of stellar mass like this, what you are seeing is probably not a lens system!"
        loner_lightweight_1: "Galaxies such as the small blue one seen here do not have large enough mass to cause the wide separation seen between the two reddish objects."
        loner_lightweight_2: "The blue fuzzy spiral galaxy, usually not massive enough to cause lensing. The blue knots do not form any expected lensing configuration and do not have similar surface brightness either."
        loner_lightweight_3: "The blue round galaxy is not massive enough to cause lensing. the blue elongated object looks like another edge-on galaxy instead of a lensed arc."
        loner_lightweight_4: "This looks like a blue fuzzy spiral, not massive enough, to cause lensing with bright spots where new stars might be forming. The bright spots do not form any expected lensing configuration."

      questions: """
        <h3>What is my main task?</h3>
        <p>The main task for the current project is to inspect each image on the classification page, look for a gravitational lens, and mark any of the lensed features you see in the image. Lens systems are rare: most of the images won't contain any lenses, but a few images will have a lens and in extremely rare cases, there might be more than one lens in an image. So, watch out!</p>
        <h3>Should I try and be inclusive, or discerning?</h3>
        <p>During a first pass through the images, when the website has a blue background, we don't want to miss any lenses: if in doubt, mark them. However, when we are trying to refine a list of candidates to identify the best ones (when the site has an orange background), we need to be more skeptical: only mark the features that you really think are due to lensing. The <a href=\"#/guide\">Spotter's Guide</a> can help you make your judgement.</p>
        <h3>I marked a simulated lens but was told that I missed it. What's the problem?</h3>
        <p>We'd like you to mark any lensed object that you see i.e. you can mark one or all of the curved arcs, or multiple quasars. Sometimes the site will tell you that you missed a simulated lens, when you actually marked something nearby the lensed object, e.g. the marker might have been placed on the lens galaxy itself instead of the lensed features.</p>
        <h3>What do I do if I see more than one lensed image per lens system?</h3>
        <p>You should place a marker on at least one lensed feature that you see per lens system. If you see an arc, mark it and preferably, mark its counter-arc if you can see it. If you see a pair of quasars (compact objects) either side of a lensing galaxy, mark both of them preferably. You only need to mark one lensed feature for your identification to be registered, but you can mark multiple features if you wish.</p>
        <h3>Are the lenses all in the middle of the images?</h3>
        <p>The images were selected to all contain objects that could either be lenses (like massive orange galaxies, or groups of galaxies), or would make interesting background sources (like quasars). The images were made so that these objects all lie at the centres of the images - so it's most likely (although not guaranteed) that if a lens is present, it will be in the middle of the field.</p>
        <h3>When should I use the Quick Dashboard?</h3>
        <p>Many lensed images are faint and very close to the bright orange lensing galaxies. You can switch to the Quick Dashboard to play with different settings or zoom/pan to get a detailed view near the lensing galaxy and be more confident of not missing a faint lens.</p>
        <h3>I missed a lens! How do I go back?</h3>
        <p>The last image you saw is in your 'Recents' list, on your <a href=\"#/profile\">Profile</a>. You can click on this image to take it to Talk, where you can tag it for other people to see, and discuss it with them.</p>
        <h3>Can I delete my markers?</h3>
        <p>Yes, if you click on one of your markers, a little cross should appear above it. If you click on this cross, the marker is deleted.</p>
        <h3>Can I turn off the simulated lenses?</h3>
        <p>We found that without the simulated lenses, we started to make mistakes. We don't want to miss any lenses, so we thought it best to keep showing simulated lenses, just in case! As you do more classifications we will show you a smaller number of simulated lenses.</p>
        <h3>Can I turn off the feedback messages?</h3>
        <p>As with the simulated lenses, we found that without the messages, we also started to make mistakes. We don't want to miss any lenses, so we thought it best to keep the messages turned on!</p>
        <h3>The images are really small! Can I make them bigger?</h3>
        <p>Yes. Click on the Quick Dashboard, and scroll with your mouse to zoom in. You can move around in the image by dragging it with your cursor.</p>
        <h3>I found something interesting! What do I do?</h3>
        <p>The markers are only for lensed features, but you can add any image, whether you think it has a lens in it or not, to your favourites using the button. This will appear in your favourites list on your profile page. You can then click on that image to take it to <a href='http://talk.spacewarps.org/'>Talk</a>, where you can discuss it with with other people.</p>
        <h3>Sometimes a vertical/horizontal section of the image looks completely dark. Why is that?</h3>
        <p>Nothing to worry about. These images are at the edges of the survey region where the telescope did not collect data. Since there's no data, these sections look dark.</p>
        <h3>I can't see some pages on the website. What internet browser should I use?</h3>
        <p>We support modern browsers, although the site is optimized for Chrome.

      questions: """
        <h3>What is a gravitational lens system?</h3>
        <p>When a massive galaxy, or cluster of galaxies, sitting right in front of another, much more distant galaxy, the light from the background galaxy gets deflected and focused towards us by the warped space around the foreground galaxy. This is referred to as a gravitational lens system.</p>

        <h3>What does a typical lens system look like?</h3>
        <p>A typical lens system will show a massive lensing galaxy or a galaxy group surrounded by magnified and distorted multiple images of a background galaxy.</p>
        
        <h3>What's the difference between a lens(ing) galaxy and a lensed galaxy?</h3>
        <p>A lens galaxy or a lensing galaxy is the foreground massive galaxy which warps the space around it and causes light to bend around it. A lensed galaxy is a distant background galaxy from which light rays emerge and get bent or deflected due to the lens galaxy before arriving on earth.</p>
        
        <h3>Why are gravitational lens systems interesting?</h3>
        <p>Gravitational lenses have a plethora of applications in astrophysics. Most importantly, they are used for understanding properties of Dark Matter which is very difficult to probe by other methods. Since lens systems also create magnified images of the distant background galaxies, we get a detailed view and hence, better understanding of these distant and faint galaxies which would be impossible otherwise. Other interesting applications include measuring the age of the Universe, finding exoplanets, etc.</p>
        
        <h3>Why do you need my help to look for gravitational lenses?</h3>
        <p>How a lens system will look like in the sky depends on several factors relating to properties of the foreground and the background object. There is enough complexity in these lens systems that the process of detection has not been fully automated till date. One of the major problems is contamination from lens-like systems e.g., spiral galaxies, ring galaxies and other artefacts in the images that mimic arc-like shapes. Human beings are better at processing and filtering objects that have multiple levels of complexities even if they are non-standard. Lens systems fall in this category and we need your help both in discovering newer types of lenses and building better algorithms.</p>
        
        <h3>How do I know what's a lens and what isn't?</h3>
        <p>We've put up some examples of lenses, and non-lenses, in the <a href=\"#/guide\">Spotter's Guide</a>. You can see these examples on the main classification page (on the pull-out tab on the right hand side), and you can click on them to read more about them in the Guide page. You can also go to <a href='http://talk.spacewarps.org/'>Talk</a> and see what other people have found.</p>
        
        <h3>What are simulated lens systems?</h3>
        <p>Simulated lens systems are computer generated images of gravitational lens systems using standard models for a foreground galaxy (or galaxy group) and a background galaxy (or a quasar). These simulated lenses are then added to the real images of the sky observed with a telescope.</p>
        
        <h3>Why do the images have simulated lens systems?</h3>
        <p>Lens systems come in a wide variety and <a href=\"#/guide\">Spotter's Guide</a> page can be used to show only typical examples of lenses. Hence, we use simulated lens system to provide further training for the users. Also, we want to do a comparison of human vs. robots (ie. automated lens finding codes) for which we need a large test sample. Adding a large sample of simulated lenses to the real data help us achieve such comparison.</p>

    quote: "&quot;Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.&quot;<br/><em>John Archibald Wheeler</em>"
    gravitational_lensing: "Gravitational Lensing"
    lensing_text_1: "Einstein's theory of gravity, General Relativity, made a remarkable prediction. Massive objects, such as stars, would bend the space around them such that passing light rays follow curved paths. Evidence for this revolutionary theory was first obtained by Arthur Eddington in 1919, when during a solar eclipse he observed that stars near the edge of the Sun appeared to be slightly out of position. The Sun was behaving like the lens in a magnifying glass and bending the light from the background stars!"
    lensing_text_2: "In 1937, Fritz Zwicky realized that massive galaxies (which can contain anywhere from ten million to a hundred trillion stars) or clusters of galaxies could be used to magnify distant galaxies that conventional telescopes couldn't detect. As you can see, not unlike a conventional magnifying glass, these gravitational lenses not only magnify and focus the light of the distant background galaxies but they can, and mostly do, distort them as well."
    lensing_text_3: "When one of these gravitational lenses happens to sit right in front of a background galaxy, the magnification factor can be up to x10 or even more, giving us a zoomed-in view of the distant universe, just at that particular point. Lenses can help us investigate young galaxies more than halfway across the universe, as they formed stars and started to take on the familiar shapes we see nearby."
    lensing_text_4: "Observations of the distorted background galaxy can also give us useful information about the object that is behaving as a gravitational lens. The separation and distortion of the lensed images can tell astronomers how much mass there is in the object, and how it is arranged. It is one of the few ways we have of mapping out where the dark matter in the universe is, how clumpy it is and how dense it is near the centers of galaxies. Knowing this can provide crucial information about how galaxies evolve."
    needles: "Needles in a Haystack"
    needles_text_1: "There is a lot of interesting science to be done with gravitational lenses. The problem is that they are very rare. Only about one in a thousand massive galaxies is aligned with a background object well enough to cause it to appear multiply-imaged. We currently know of about 400 objects that are behaving as gravitational lenses, largely because we have become very good at observing the night sky! Modern optical surveys cover thousands of square degrees, with images sharp and deep enough to resolve about 1 lens per square degree. There should be thousands of lenses that we can detect, but we will need to look at millions of galaxy images to find them!"
    needles_text_2: "The ideal solution would be to get a computer to look through all of the images, but unfortunately this is not a straightforward solution. Teaching a computer to recognize the effects of gravitational lensing is not too difficult, but they can be easily confused by galaxies that look very similar to a distorted background galaxy. Also in order for the computer to run fast enough to analyse lots of images quickly, they have to cut a lot of corners, and this makes them less effective."
    discovering: "Discovering Lenses: A Human-Computer Partnership"
    discovering_text: "Human beings have a remarkable ability to recognise patterns and detect the unusual with only minimal training. With a basic understanding of what the distorted images of galaxies that have passed through a gravitational lens look like, participants in the SpaceWarps project can help discover new examples of this amazing phenomenon, and enable our survey scientists to carry out new investigations of stars and dark matter in the universe. We do two types of lens search. In our blind searches, we volunteers to spot signs of gravitational lensing in images of the sky taken as part of the CFHT (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope) legacy survey. This survey has been searched by computers, but we're pretty sure they didn't catch all the lenses to be found! These results will help us re-train the computers to do better on larger surveys in future. Then, in our targeted searches, in other upcoming sky surveys, we'll be showing participants galaxies and groups of galaxies that our computers have selected as possibly being gravitational lenses. The task will then be to assess whether or not they actually are! In both cases, there will be confusing objects around - the challenge is to come up with the most plausible explanation for what is going on, in collaboration with the rest of the SpaceWarps community. Do you think you can spot outer space being warped? We do!"

    searching: "Searching in Stages"
    searching_text: "Each lens search has two stages. In the first one, we ask the community to &quot;spot&quot; gravitational lens systems, with the emphasis on completeness. At this stage, we don't want to miss anything interesting! If in doubt, mark it and discuss it in Talk. In the second stage, &quot;refine&quot;, things are a little different: by this point, we'll have identified (together) a number of lens candidates, and it will be time to start refining this sample to identify the really promising ones. We want to reject the &quot;false positives&quot;, and focus on the objects that really look like lenses. We use the same interface - just with a more critical eye. The goal is to assemble, together, a small list of very good lens candidates for the Science Team to follow up with big telescopes. And big telescope time is not cheap, so we're after the very best lens candidates! You will know which stage we are on by the color of the website: if it is blue, we're trying to spot the candidates, and if it is orange, we're trying to refine them."

She became fascinated by gravitational lenses during her PhD in which she studied some of the most luminous galaxies seen in the Universe, some of which have been gravitationally lensed. Aprajita is interested in making use of gravitational lenses as natural telescopes to study the galaxies that are being lensed in more detail than would normally be possible, as well as measuring the light and dark matter in the lensing galaxies themselves. Having worked with citizen scientists looking for gravitational lenses in Galaxy Zoo, she was inspired by their efforts, motivating the emergence of Space Warps."

She likes to find these rare systems and study them to learn more about the mysterious dark matter and how it influences the galaxies hosted within. She's interested in developing better algorithms to find lens systems automatically in order to solve the &quot;needle in a haystack&quot; problem. She led the first Space Warps project using data from the CFHT Legacy Survey. With the help of citizen scientists, she can find the lenses that were missed by her arc-finding algorithm which will help her improve the algorithm. This will be extremely useful when doing lens searches with future large imaging surveys."

So, when she discovered GalaxyZoo, it was the chance of a lifetime to get seriously involved. This resulted in, among other things, moderating the discussion in several different projects (Solar StormWatch, Old Weather, IceHunters and recently for GalaxyZoo Talk) and classifying in many more. Before GalaxyZoo came along she had only some vague notions of what a gravitational lens was, but she quickly became intrigued by them and spent hours searching the SDSS images for potential lenses. She is looking forward to doing some serious lens hunting!"

    lensed_galaxies_text_1: "In general, galaxies can be big (massive) or small (compact), with a clear shape or morphology (e.g. spiral and elliptical galaxies) or messy (e.g. irregular, clumpy and merging galaxies). As they are made up of many stars, galaxies generally appear to be extended in astronomical images, unlike single stars that just look like compact, round sources."
    lensed_galaxies_text_2: "Galaxies with lots of stars or mass can act as cosmic telescopes and bend light of a galaxy lying behind them into multiple images. Typically the most massive galaxies appear yellow-red in colour (the colour is indicative of old stars that are massive). They usually have a smooth distribution of light and are spherical or elliptical in shape. Similarly, the central bulges of large galaxies can be massive enough to cause lensing."
    lensed_galaxies_text_3: "When a distant galaxy (background source) is lensed by a galaxy lying between us and the galaxy, you can get multiple images of the galaxy that typically trace a circle around the lensing galaxy, see the examples below. The last example shows the case when the background source and the lensing galaxy almost exactly aligned along the of sight to us - this produces a lensed image that is a ring, usually referred to as an Einstein ring."
    lensed_galaxies_text_4: "If you look at the examples below you will probably have already noticed that the lensed or distorted images tend to be blue rather than the yellow/red of the lensing galaxy. This is partly because more distant galaxies are more likely to be young and so they have a lot of young stars that predominantly create more energetic photons or blue light. In addition, distant galaxies are &quot;redshifted&quot; this means the light you actually see originated from a shorter or bluer wavelength. Hence distant galaxies tend to look blue. While this is typically true for most of the lenses you will see, if these objects are at very high redshift, it can be that the bright blue photons that are emitted are so far away that they actually arrive at earth at even longer wavelengths. These images will appear red in our colour composites. So don't reject red arcs or images - these could just be at high redshift! There's an example of a high-redshift lensed quasar in lensed quasars."
    lensed_galaxies_text_5: "This faint blue galaxy is being magnified and distorted into an arc by the massive red galaxy. See how the arc curves around the lens. If you look closely there is a hint of a counter-image (a second image opposite side of the lens to the primary arc). It is the same colour as the primary arc but it is typically fainter. Because of this sometimes the counter image is bright enough to be seen but sometimes it is too faint to be seen."
    lensed_galaxies_text_6: "Very massive galaxies can cause multiple images to form. Here you see a blue arc and two additional blue images, these are arranged roughly on a circle around the lensing galaxy. This standard lens configuration is called the fold configuration."
    lensed_galaxies_text_7: "Very massive galaxies can cause multiple images to form, arranged roughly on a circle around themselves."
    lensed_galaxies_text_8: "In the very rare instance that a background galaxy is (almost perfectly) aligned to the foreground galaxy along the line of sight to us, the light of the background galaxy is deflected in all directions. This give rise to a ring-like lensed image and is called an Einstein Ring."
    lensed_galaxies_text_9: "Spiral galaxies are like fried eggs: the bulge of stars in the middle is the yolk, while the spiral arms lie in the thin layer of egg white. Imagine sticking two fried eggs to either side of a circle of cardboard, and then looking at the whole thing from the side. That's what an edge-on spiral galaxy looks like. These are not usually very massive but some of them can act as lenses. Above are some examples of what edge-on lens systems look like."
    
    lensed_quasars_text_1: "Quasars or quasi-stellar objects are very compact galaxies that have very bright central regions that outshine the rest of the galaxy making it look &quot;star-like&quot;. The nucleus is so bright because it is massive and it is made up of millions of stars with a very massive black hole. As matter falls into the black hole it lights up making the nucleus very bright. When a compact object like a quasar is lensed by a galaxy that's lying between us and the quasar it is lensed into discrete multiple images like the examples shown below. Quasars are rare compared to galaxies and hence, lensed quasars are even rarer than lensed galaxies. Below the examples show quasars lensed by a single galaxy, quasars lensed by a galaxy group are even rarer. To date, only three quasars lensed by a galaxy group/cluster have been found."
    double: "Double"
    lensed_quasars_text_2: "This is a bright blue &quot;quasi-stellar object&quot; behind a massive galaxy: it has been lensed into two images, one on either side of the lens galaxy."
    quad: "Quad"
    lensed_quasars_text_3: "This quasar has been lensed into four images, arranged around the galaxy. This is called the Einstein cross configuration. Quads are about 6 times rarer than doubles."
    high_z: "High-z"
    lensed_quasars_text_4: "This is a quasar at high redshift, so it appears yellow-ish. The image configuration in this case is a quad, with two of the quad images very close together."
    
    group_lenses_text_1: "Galaxy groups and clusters are gravitationally bound entities. They mark the most massive regions in the Universe. As such these are the most powerful cosmic telescopes and can produce large and spectacular arcs and multiple images. See the examples below."
    group_lenses_text_2: "Groups or clusters of massive red galaxies can lens background galaxies into long, bright arcs. These arcs are typically less curved and at larger separations from the lensing galaxies than would be seen for a single lensing galaxy. This is because groups and clusters of galaxies are much more massive than a single galaxy and so the deflection of the image (or separation) can be larger."
    group_lenses_text_3: "Groups and clusters of massive galaxies can form many images, often of more than one background galaxy. The bright images curve around the entire lens that can be several galaxies."
    
    gallery_text: "Automated searches have detected nearly one hundred gravitational lenses (or high probability candidates) in the CFHTLS area. In this gallery, each one is shown at the centre of a zoomed-in image that is one quarter the size of a regular Space Warps image."

    stars: "Stars"
    
    rings_spirals_text_1: "Star-forming galaxies are very common. They typically are blue entirely or show a blue component of emission, this could include spiral arms, a ring, or star-forming knots/clumps. Star-forming galaxies are not the most massive galaxies but the active star-formation produces a lot of blue light. Spiral arms, such as those in the Milky Way, are often seen around a bulge that is often more red or yellow in colour. Ring galaxies may be formed by the interaction of two star-forming galaxies, in this case a distinct ring of blue light is seen around a bright core. Depending on orientation, spiral arms and rings can look similar to gravitationally lensed images of a background galaxy, these are common false positives. They often have red or yellow bulges that can mimic a massive lensing galaxy; but the arms or rigns don't have the right shape to be lensed arcs. As well as rings and spiral arms, star-forming galaxies can also have irregular shapes (i.e. those without a well defined shape) or they could be two galaxies in the process of a merger (see the Mergers &amp; Neighbors tab). Both are often dominated by blue light from star-formation. Sometimes star forming clumps in a galaxy can also be symmetrically arranged around the red core of a galaxy and resemble gravitationally lensed quasars. Some tips on how to distinguish these false positives from the real thing are below."
    arms: "Spiral Arms"
    rings_spirals_text_2: "These often have yellow &quot;bulges&quot; and blue &quot;spiral arms.&quot; Unlike gravitationally lensed arcs, the arms don't trace a rough circle around the bulge, and they are usually accompanied by some fuzzy distribution of light. This example shows a small spiral galaxy, you can see the upper blue arm very clearly and the opposing second arm is much fainter. You can see the underlying fuzz of the disk of the galaxy. You would see much more clearly defined arcs and no fuzzy component in a gravitational lens with arcs."
    rings: "Rings"
    rings_spirals_text_3: "Their yellow bulges are surrounded by complete, oval rings of blue light, they are typically wider than a gravitationally lensed arc or ring. Einstein Rings are typically more circular, and brighter."
    rings_spirals_text_4: "Here's an example of a field that contains two galaxies with rings. The bright blue galaxy in the zoomed image has a blue-white core surrounded by a similarly coloured ring or halo and a spiral arm or a tidal tail. The ring around the core is not due to lensing, it may be a part of a star-forming disk or be a feature that it generated by the merger of two star-forming galaxies. To the upper right of this bright blue galaxy in the zoomed image, is a small yellow galaxy surrounded by a bluish ring. While in this case the bulge of the galaxy is a yellow not blue, the surrounding blue ring is too fuzzy and wide to be caused by lensing."
    clumps: "Clumps"
    rings_spirals_text_5: "Sometimes star-forming clumps can look like lensed quasars or compact sources. In this example, there are clumps of bright blue emission arranged in a ring around the central yellow bulge. The star forming ring and clumps dominate the blue light. If this was a gravitational lens the images would be configured in characteristic patterns as shown in Real Lenses: Lensed Quasars. Star-forming clumps aren't always arranged nicely in a ring like in this example, clumps may just be randomly distributed around a galaxy, in the spiral arms or in a disk (see Loners for some isolated clumpy galaxies)."
    red: "Red star-forming galaxies"
    rings_spirals_text_6: "Star-forming galaxies that have very old stars or have a lot of dust in them can often have very red looking bulges or cores. &quot;Dust&quot; is a product of stellar evolution and can absorb the blue light produced in stars and then re-radiate it at longer wavelengths, hence the galaxy can look red. Such galaxies also can have blue neighbouring features, such as clumps, arms and rings that suggest that can be mistaken for gravitational lenses. In this example, a red compact galaxy has blue clumpy arcs arranged around it. These are likely to be spiral arms in a disk surrounding the red bulge. Lensing would have a more circular and less diffuse shape. The red objects either side may be stars or neighbouring galaxies. If they are the latter, the similar red colours to the main galaxy suggests that they are at the same redshift and the three galaxies may form a small group."
    isolated_blue: "Isolated Blue Irregular Galaxy"
    loners_text_1: "We have put a selection of objects that look like blue arcs in this page, however these are not gravitationally lensed systems. The easiest check is that there is no plausible massive gravitational lens in their vicinity. See below for some examples."
    loners_text_2: "Some faint blue galaxies appear arc-like. If there isn't a massive galaxy present, it is almost certainly not being lensed!"
    loners_text_3: "This example is very elongated, like a cluster arc - but there is no cluster of massive yellow galaxies present."
    loners_text_4: "This example is a bright boomerang shaped blue galaxy. There is a very faint hint of a red galaxy, but to make such a large bright lensed galaxy would need a very massive galaxy or group of galaxies. The faint red object is so small that it is unlikely to create such a large lensed image. Moreover, we can't be sure that the red light is real, it could well be an image artifact or a noisy pixel."
    blue_group: "Blue Group"
    loners_text_5: "Faint blue galaxies can appear in groups and clusters too, and sometimes the galaxies in those groups can look aligned in an arc shape so they look a bit like multiple lensed images - but with no lens!"
    
    lightweights_text_1: "As we described  previously, a galaxy needs to be massive to act as a gravitational lens. Spiral and irregular galaxies are not massive enough to cause strong gravitational lensing usually. However, there are some known cases of spiral galaxies (both seen face-on and edge-on) acting as gravitational lenses. While thinking about whether you are seeing gravitational lensing it is worthwhile considering if the object you think is the lens is massive enough or is it a &quot;lightweight&quot;? Do you see any other evidence that might disfavor lensing e.g. the lensed images are too far or the arc is too straight? Here are some examples."
    arclets: "Straight or Distant Arclets"
    lightweights_text_2: "Sometimes a yellow/red galaxy is present near a blue arc but its too small to create such a large or separated arc. The arc might appear too curved or curved in the wrong direction (it doesn't encircle the lensing galaxy). In the case above, the arc is too far away to be lensed by such a small galaxy."
    bulgeless_blue: "Bulgeless Blue Galaxies"
    lightweights_text_3: "The most massive galaxies have bulges of yellow/red stars - bulgeless, blue galaxies usually don't have enough mass to strongly deflect light. Such galaxies are less likely to act as lenses."
    
    mergers: "Mergers"
    mergers_neighbors_text_1: "As you may have seen in Galaxy Zoo, galaxies are moving objects that sometime collide and interact. This produces a single more massive galaxy at the end, but as the interaction is very complex and slow, spiral arms and star forming regions from both of the merging galaxies can be tidally distorted and drawn out. Usually, these merging galaxies can be identified due to their similar colors since such galaxies have roughly similar stellar population and ages. Below we give an example of how such mergers can be mistaken to be a lensing galaxy. Arms and tidal tails around the central redder bulge of the merging galaxies can end up looking similar to long blue arcs seen in lensing by galaxy groups."
    mergers_neighbors_text_2: "Sometimes two neighbouring galaxies, that aren't physically associated to each other but are simply next to each other, can look like a lens. This is just a chance or random alignment of galaxies. For lensing candidates remember to look for an arc that is defined and curved around a plausible lensing galaxy, and also look for hints of a counter image. If things look very nebulous and fuzzy or curved the wrong way, it is most likely this isn't a lens. Below we give examples of how such mergers or neighbours can be mistaken to be lensed systems."
    mergers_neighbors_text_3: "Two galaxies merging together can look a bit like a lens system. Here two spiral galaxies appear to be merging, you can see two reddish bulges with multiple arms visible and a fuzzy distribution of light. Sometimes mergers cause displaced arms, or tidal tails. Unlike arcs, the arms or tidal tails do not trace a circle around the red bulge."
    neighbouring_galaxies: "Neighbouring Galaxies"
    mergers_neighbors_text_4: "Sometimes two neighbouring galaxies can look a bit like a lens system. In these cases, the supposed &quot;arc&quot; is usually not bright enough, it is not clearly defined or is fuzzy or the &quot;lens&quot; is not massive enough (as above)."
    mergers_neighbors_text_5: "Here you see a bright yellow galaxy, and if you look closely to the top of the galaxy you can just make out two small neighbours. One of the neighbours is blue, and the other is a similar colour to the main yellow galaxy. In this case, it's likely that the small yellow galaxy is probably a direct neighbour of the brighter and larger yellow galaxy, this could be a satellite galaxy (at the same redshift and type as the main galaxy). The blue compact object is also likely to be a galaxy but it is not clear if it is at the same redshift as the yellow galaxy or it could simply be a chance alignment of a blue galaxy with the yellow galaxy (different redshift, just end up being neighbours in the 2D projection)."

    stars_text_1: "Stars are bright compact sources that can show strange features depending on how bright they are. The stars in our galaxy have a range of properties, including temperature that determines the colour they are. If they are young stars, they are typically hot and blue in colour, older stars are cooler and red. Yellow or red stars can be mistaken to be very round galaxies and look a bit like those that are typical lenses. See the example below:"
    stars_text_2: "This field shows some compact objects that are stars. Some of the bright red and blue stars have been marked in the right image by red and blue arrows, respectively. Sometimes blue background galaxies lie close to these red stars and give the impression that they are lenses. To determine if you are looking at a star or a galaxy a quick check is to look out for faint symmetric spikes emanating from the compact sources (faint spikes are marked in grey). These spikes are caused by the structure in the telescope, and stars are so compact and bright that they can cause these spikes to be recorded on the detector. They are not inherent features of the star but just an artifact caused by the light of the star passing into the telescope. These features are called diffraction spikes."
    stars_text_3: "For extremely bright stars, these spikes become very pronounced. Such bright stars can actually overwhelm the detector and cause pixels some strange effects. In this case the detector pixels have received so much light that they have become saturated. Saturation causes very strange effects like the one seen above. A lot of the light from the bright star has spilled out into a large white halo and along the diffraction spikes. Further out from the star, multi-coloured rings or halos may also be seen. The rings are not related to lensing but due to effects generated by the optical elements of the telescope."
    stars_text_4: "On less bright stars you can often see similar halos that are located closer to the star. Sometimes these are blue or red, and they are again due to optical effects. The reason blue or red halos are seen is because the effects of lots of photons from the compact stars causes differences in the detectors in different colours, i.e. if the star is bigger in the blue filter than the red filter you will see a blue ring around it."
    stars_text_5: "Here's one of the CFHTLS images that we've marked up with stars and galaxies. It doesn't contain any gravitational lens candidates, but it hopefully gives you an idea of what different kinds of objects look like in the CFHT images. Note that the blue star to the left has black marks above and below the white/blue core. This is one of the artifacts associated to saturation. The detector becomes so overwhelmed that the data recorded in that pixel becomes unreadable and in software the pixel is flagged as not having a real measurement in it. This results in black pixels that do not contain any information as the measurement is unreliable."
    stars_text_6: "Another example of the effect of saturated pixels is shown to the right where you see a black rectangle around the north-south diffraction spike, note the yellow and red along the centre are also a saturation effect and no reliable flux measurement can be taken for such a saturated object."

    artifacts_text_1: "The process of recording astronomical images into the nice maps of the sky you see here  can lead to some interesting looking artifacts in the data that aren't real. In addition there are real objects in the sky that are moving (either fast or slow) that can leave strange features in the data. In looking for these artifacts remember that the images we present you are colour images made up of three channels: red, green and blue. Some of these artifacts effects can only one of the channels, leading to pure red, green or blue features. The actual astronomical filters we use in these colour channels are red: i-band (just outside the visible range our eyes are sensitive to), green: r-band (middle wavelength, the reddest light our eyes can see), and blue: g-band (what our eyes would see as green). There are some examples of moving target artifacts below and examples of artifacts caused by bright stars can be found in False Positives: Stars." 
    fast_moving: "Fast moving objects (e.g. fast asteroids, satellites, planes)"
    artifacts_text_2: "These are examples of fast moving objects. As the camera observes the sky for a fixed amount of time per exposure, fast moving objects make trails in the data. Left image: the object was only in the field when the green image was taken therefore it appears green. Right image: the object was only in the field in the blue image and therefore it appears blue. Its trail has a break in it as the image you see is actually made up of several images that were taken close together (probably consecutive exposures), so the moving target looks like it has effectively jumped in it's trails from one frame to the next."
    slow_moving: "Slow moving objects (e.g. distant asteroids, slow moving satellites)"
    artifacts_text_3: "In the top left of the left image above you see an object that is lime green with a very blue neighbour (a zoomed in view is seen in the top right box). This is an asteroid. The asteroid appears both lime green and blue becuase it has moved between exposures taken in the filters that make up this colour image. As the sky images are collected filter by filter (not necessarily on consecutive nights) moving objects like these get smeared out. In this case, the green and red channel data were taken close together, this produces the lime green image of the object, and then blue channel data was taken at a different time causing the blue image to be offset from the lime green one. The history behind this is image is actually a little more complicated than that, as the image in each channel is actually made up of several images that have been stacked and stiched onto each other. If you look carefully at the blue image of the asteroid, you will see that it is not just a uniform blue, there is a greenish-blue bright semi-circle. What you are seeing here is that the upper corner of the green channel image is actually made up of another image in which the asteroid has moved. This was taken at a close time to the blue image, but in this case not all the asteroid was covered by that image. The bottom line of the semi-circle denotes the edge of one of the input images where the asteroid was only partially captured by that image. This is why you see a differently coloured (green) semi-circle in the blue image. Below you can see the image that went into the green channel (this is taken with the r-band filter of the CFHT) where you can clearly see the asteroid and a half!"
    artifacts_text_4: "You can also see another artifact in this image. There is some green fuzz in a vertical stripe down one third of the way from the left of the image. This is the result of the stacking and stiching of images to produce this image. Because this is green, it means that this noisy component comes from the green channel which is the r-band image. So you can also see it as a noisy stripe in the r-band image on the right above. This marks an overlap between individual images where the edge of one of the input images is noisier than the others. This is usually becuase in these stripes there is actually less data than other regions of the image, less data means the noise is a more dominant feature."
    artifacts_text_5: "In this image there is a pure green spot. This is likely to be a moving target that was slow moving so it doesn't appear as a trail. What has happened in this case is that the images used for the red and blue channels were taken at a very different time to the green by which time the object has moved. Note that stars and galaxies are never single colours as they have a broad wavelength range over which they emit and they do not move fast enough to cause trails or appear in only one of the colour channels."

    intro_VICS82_text_1: "Welcome to the VICS82 survey!"
    intro_VICS82_whats_all_this: "What are we looking at?"
    intro_VICS82_text_2: "In this project we are asking you to look for gravitational lenses in infrared images, where the most distant galaxies in the Universe can be seen. The survey images were taken using three filters (i, J and Ks) on two different telescopes (CFHT and VISTA), and combined into a color composite. Massive galaxies appear orange, while star-forming galaxies in the background can be blue, turquoise, green or red, depending on how far away they are. Quasars (very distant supermassive black holes that glow as they consume the gas around themselves) look like stars (ie, small and round) that are all sorts of colours: turquoise, green, purple and even pink..."
    intro_VICS82_text_3: "Each image is known to contain, at the center of the field, an object that could either be a lens, or a source that would be interesting if it was lensed. You will see groups and clusters of galaxies, that can distort background galaxies into arcs, and massive galaxies that might have &quot;Einstein Rings&quot; around them. And you'll also see colourful quasars, which might have twins a short distance away, with a lens galaxy in between them..."
    intro_VICS82_text_4: "You'll notice that the background sky looks quite grainy, with lots of red and green dots. Astronomers call this &quot;noise&quot; - it comes from the atmosphere above our heads, which is warm and so appears bright in an IR image. We've removed as much of this sky background as we can, and now have to peer through the noise as best we can. One thing to remember is that the noise dots are smaller than the stars and galaxies: so for an object to be real, and not just noise, it can't be smaller that about 4 pixels."
    intro_VICS82_hows_it_different: "How is this different from previous Space Warps projects?"
    intro_VICS82_text_5: "Previously on Space Warps we were investigating images taken in the  optical part of the spectrum as part of the CFHT Legacy Survey (CFHTLS), where nearby massive galaxies look bright yellow, and star-forming galaxies in the background look bright blue. We were also doing a &quot;blind&quot; search, where there was not a target in the center of each image - and the images had larger fields of view, about 70 arcsec compared to the 40 arcsec of VICS82. Finally, the CFHTLS images are &quot;deeper&quot; (the exposure times were longer), so more galaxies can be seen in any given area than in VICS82. The consequence of this is that lenses will be harder to spot in VICS82!"
    intro_VICS82_text_6: "However, gravitational lensing works in the infrared the same way as it does in the optical: this means that we should see the same characteristic patterns of arcs, counter-arcs, rings and multiple image systems in the VICS82 images as we did in the CFHTLS ones, its just the colours will be a bit different - and the lensed features will be more difficult to pick out."
    intro_VICS82_text_7: "There are a few ways to get round these problems, and explore the data further. On the main classification page you can check out any faint fuzzy features using the &quot;Quick Dashboard,&quot; where you can zoom in on an interesting object, and view it using different colour settings. If you look to the bottom right of the Quick Dashboard disply you can also download the individual files that make up the colour image. The image shown in blue is from the i-band, and is the deepest, most sensitive one; the near-infrared J-band is shown in green and the longer wavelength Ks-band in shown in red. Another way to explore these images in more detail is in Talk, where you can use the Full Dashboard in &quot;Tools&quot; to view the separate channel images and play with the display levels for each."
